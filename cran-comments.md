## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* Chances are that the Ubuntu version (R CMD Check) would have a NOTE saying that lib is large (~40MB). It is due to large C++ compiled objects. I am not sure what to do about that, so I just leave it as it is...
* Thanks for your time reading this and thank you for your help through my CRAN submission process!
