Description: This package implements a novel forward stepwise discriminant analysis framework 
    that integrates Pillaiâ€™s trace with Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA), 
    providing an improvement over traditional stepwise LDA methods that rely on Wilks' Lambda. 
    The replacement of Wilks' Lambda with Pillai's trace allows the method to better handle 
    scenarios involving perfect group separation, where Wilks' Lambda fails. 
    The package is particularly useful for high-dimensional data where the within-class 
    scatter matrix is non-invertible. It offers robust feature selection and classification 
    accuracy.
